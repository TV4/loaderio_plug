# LoaderioPlug

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `loaderio_plug` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:loaderio_plug, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

If on Elixir version less than 1.4, then ensure that `loaderio_plug` is started before your application:

```elixir
def application do
  [applications: [:loaderio_plug]]
end
```
